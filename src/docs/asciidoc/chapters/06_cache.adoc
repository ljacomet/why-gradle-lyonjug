== Build cache

=== How does it work?

Gradle is reusing results +
from *last time*  +
when we ran *this build* +
 on *this machine*. +

=== Gradle can do better

=== Why not...

Reuse results +
from *anytime before*  +
when we ran *any build* +
 *anywhere*. +

=== Demo

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Use Ehcache 3
* Show incremental builds
* Show build cache with a git worktree
--

=== Builds on top of incremental builds

[%step]
* Get reliable incremental builds first
* Next work on making them cacheable
* Cacheable tasks require additional information for path sensitivity

=== Repeatable outputs

[%step]
* Same inputs must produce same outputs
* May be byte-for-byte equivalent
* May be semantically equivalent (with normalization)

=== Normalization

[%step]
* `@InputFiles` - no normalization
* `@CompileClasspath` - Extracts ABI from classes
* `@Classpath` - treats files as a runtime Java classpath
* Configurable runtime normalization to ignore files

=== Deploying a build cache

* Stable for Java, Groovy and Scala projects
* Gradle Enterprise provides a backend for managing, monitoring and replicating caches
* Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/gradle/build-cache-node/[gradle/build-cache-node]
