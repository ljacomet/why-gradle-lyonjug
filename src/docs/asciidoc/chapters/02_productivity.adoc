=== Maximum build performance

> *Maximum build performance* is the maximum achievable performance of a build system *for your code base.*

=== Measure

Needs data
[%step]
* CI server captures times ✅
* What about developer builds  ❌

=== Optimization

[%step]
* Requires actionable feedback!

=== Reliability

This makes the quality of a tool

=== Personal experience

[%step]
* Large Java multi project with 20+ projects
* Using Maven as the build tool
[%step]
** Minutes to get a product archive with `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
** Full build on CI takes 2h30+
* Migrated to Gradle
[%step]
** Seconds to get a product archive with `./gradlew assemble`
** Full build on CI takes 40 minutes, thanks to parallelization

=== How

[%step]
* Compile avoidance
* Incremental compilation
* Incremental builds
* Parallelization
* Build cache
