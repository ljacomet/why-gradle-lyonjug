== Modelling the system

=== Compile classpath

What does a *compiler* care about?

[%step]
* Input: jars, or class directories
* Jar: class files
* Class file: both API and implementation

=== Compile classpath

What we provide to the compiler

```
public class Foo {
    private int x = 123;

    public int getX() { return x; }
    public int getSquaredX() { return x * x; }
}
```

=== Compile classpath

What the compiler cares about:

```
public class Foo {
    public int getX()
    public int getSquaredX()
}
```

=== Compile classpath

But it could also be

```
public class Foo {
    public int getSquaredX()
    public int getX()
}
```

**only public signatures matter**

=== Runtime classpath

What does the runtime care about?

=== Runtime classpath

What does the runtime care about:

```
public class Foo {
    private int x = 123;

    public int getX() { return x; }
    public int getSquaredX() { return x * x; }
}
```

At runtime, *everything* matters, from classes to resources.

=== Compile avoidance

[%step]
* _compile_ and _runtime_ classpath have different _semantics_
* Gradle models the difference
* Ignores irrelevant (non ABI) changes to compile classpath

=== Icing on the cake

[%step]
* Upgrade a dependency from `1.0.1` to `1.0.2`
* If ABI hasn't changed, Gradle will _not_ recompile
* Even if the name of the jar is different (`mydep-1.0.1.jar` vs `mydep-1.0.2.jar`)
* Because only _contents_ matter

=== More modelling with dependencies configurations

[%step]
* `implementation` indicates an internal dependency
* consumers _will not_ see it on their `compileClasspath`
* consumers _will_ see it on their `runtimeClasspath`
* `api` indicates that the dependency needs to be on consumers' `compileClasspath`

=== Configuration mapping

[%step]
* `compile` and `runtime` were _only_ about _compilation_
* `api`, `implementation` and friends are about _compilation_ and _publication / consumption_
