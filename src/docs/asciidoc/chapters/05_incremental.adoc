== Incremental builds

=== Why does it matter?

* Gradle is meant for incremental builds
* `clean` is a waste of time

=== The _incrementality_ test

[%step]
* Run a build
* Run again with no change
* If a task was re-executed, time is wasted
[%step]
** Investigate!

=== Properly writing tasks

=== Example: building a shaded jar

[source,groovy]
----
task shadedJar(type: ShadedJar) {
   jarFile = file("$buildDir/libs/shaded.jar")
   classpath = configurations.runtime
   mapping = ['org.apache': 'shaded.org.apache']
}
----

* What are the task inputs?
* What are the task outputs?
* What if one of them changes?

=== Declaring inputs

[source,java]
----
public class ShadedJar extends DefaultTask {
   ...
   @InputFiles
   FileCollection getClasspath() { ... }

   @Input
   Map<String, String> getMapping() { ... }
}
----

=== Declaring outputs

[source,java]
----
public class ShadedJar extends DefaultTask {
   ...

   @OutputFile
   File getJarFile() { ... }
}
----

=== Know why your task is out-of-date

=== Incremental task inputs

* Know precisely _which_ files have changed
* Task action can perform the minimal amount of work
